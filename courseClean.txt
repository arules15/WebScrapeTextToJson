"Description": "This course is structured to enhance the continued learning and language proficiency of ESL students. Students are exposed to theory and skills that foster critical reading, writing, speaking, thinking, and reasoning. Students apply theory and skills to the analysis of timely culturally relevant social, ethical, and/or pop culture issues. Given the smaller class size, students can expect opportunities of continued experiential education built into the course. Finally, students can expect to see real improvement in their abilities to be both respectfully curious individuals and reasonable skeptics - practices that are helpful in other academic courses and life generally. Students who have been admitted to York University with an ESL requirement, or can demonstrate an ESL need, will be given permission to enrol in this course. Contact the Department of Philosophy or course instructor (Lcarozza@yorku.ca) for guidance.

"Course": "FACC 6400 3.00 - Research Methods and Statistical Inference", 
"Description": "This course has four principal objectives. The first is to help students take a more structured and scientific approach to the evaluation of data. Managers are literally bombarded with data (the information overload problem) and must be able to filter and assess the quality of such data before inputting into managerial decision models. The ability to evaluate the quality of data and to make generalizations from it using the principles of statistical inference are critical skills for all mangers. The second objective of the course is to show how risk and uncertainty can be incorporated into decision making using techniques such as Probability theory and Bayesian inference. The third objective to show how data is qualitatively evaluated using the principles of evidence. Managers should be adept in evaluating both the sufficiency and persuasiveness of evidence used in decision models. The fourth objective is to show students how to prepare a research proposal to address any business problem. This is obviously essential for students pursuing the major paper option, but any manager benefits from recognizing when sound methodological principles have been followed in researching a business question. Managers read and possibly rely on many research reports over their careers and it is important to be able to distinguish good research from weak research."

If Cronenberg's horror upsets civil society by showing it inside-out, maybe it is because our anxiety over insurrection depends ultimately on whether we stand to gain or lose power by it. Cronenberg's oeuvre insists that, as long as social progress is the legitimating function of horror text, we will not have the vocabulary to really speak or dream horror's end. Skills in critical reading, writing, analysis and argument are required and will be further developed in the course. Students must be prepared to read and write numerous essays and a final exam.
