# WebScrapeTextToJson
A short java script to convert text obtained from the yorku courses webscraper here https://github.com/SanjayP9/Yorku-Course-Site/tree/master/page-scrape to a .txt in json format
run noApos first, then on the file noApos edited, run main script TextToJson, and then on that file, run noBracks, 
data should be mostly clean JSON except about 10 or so non-formatted junk data u can find and delete (all of this
garbage json should be at places where the curly braces werent closed properly, or there is a missing '"')
