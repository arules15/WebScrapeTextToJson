The comics form is unique precisely because they can serve as a visual witness to the embodied lives lived outside the normative social structure and can work to make space for subjugated knowledge. The theoretical foundations of this course will be two-fold. The comics will be viewed through critical anti-oppressive theories such as critical race theory, feminisms, disability and queer theory. Alongside, comics theories will provide the student with insight into the general mechanics of the medium: the framing and pacing of the panels, the gutters between, and the iconic speech bubbles. Combined, these theories will guide students to understand how specifically comics can work to disrupt dominant narratives and has become a quiet but powerful social activist art form.

This course will explore how modern design in East Asia has been adapted, practiced, theorized and discussed as an interactive process between heritage rich cultures of East Asia and modernism in the West. We will examine the terminology of design in the East Asian context, key designers and their works, movements, and definitions and developments-oriental modernity, nationalism and political ideology-within regional and international design frameworks. Through this examination, students will explore the significance of the connections between design artefacts and everyday life. This course will stimulate a transnational and interdisciplinary understanding of material culture in the age of globalization by reflecting on the past, present and future of East Asian design.

"Course": "ECON 1530 3.00 - Introductory Mathematical Economics I", 
"Description": "This course presents and analyzes a sequence of basic ideas, topics and problems arising in Economics. For each idea/topic/problem relevant mathematical ideas and techniques are recalled and/or derived so as to provide a deeper understanding of the Economic issue and how it can be resolved, if necessary. The notion of Quantity Demanded is first addressed by expressing quantity demanded as a linear function of price where both the slope and intercept embed important Economics ideas. This sequence leads naturally to the notion of Revenue (the product of quantity demanded and price) where nonlinear functions are analyzed using mathematical techniques that include derivatives. This sequence culminates with notions of prices that maximize revenue subject to a given demand function. A large number of such topic sequences involving univariate functions are examined. Prerequisite: Grade 12U Advanced Functions or equivalent. Prerequisites or corequisites: AP/ECON 1000 3.00 or AP/ECON 1010 3.00, or equivalent.

Again, relevant mathematical ideas and techniques are recalled and/or derived so as to provide a deeper understanding of Economic issues and how they can be resolved. The issues and problems covered require functions of more than one variable for their resolution. The notion of Quantity Supplied is combined with the notion of Quantity Demanded and notions of Market Equilibrium are introduced and discussed. Equilibria are evaluated through the introduction of mathematical notions and properties of systems of equations, eventually in matrix form. A deeper understanding of theories of demand (supply) and the foundations of demand (supply) functions is developed through the introduction of mathematical notions of unconstrained and constrained optimization and linear and nonlinear programming. As in AP/ECON 1530 3.00, many topics and issues are addressed and problem framing and problem solving abilities are enhanced. Prerequisite: AP/ECON 1530 3.00 or equivalent.

"Description": "Mathematics learning at the K-8 level is best supported with multiple representations and hands-on activities. This course will offer opportunities for future PJ and JI teachers to explore these key mathematical processes, identified in the Ontario curriculum, through investigations, reflections, and selective readings from the literature. Many pre-service teachers have not themselves experienced learning and doing mathematics with these broader, more connected and inclusive approaches. They lack the confidence and the background resources to support these mathematical processes and approaches with their students. Reworking sample mathematics with these supports, including manipulatives (as described in the Ontario Curriculum) and appropriate technology (dynamic geometry, as identified in the Ontario Curriculum) provides opportunities for future teachers to develop their mathematical repertoire and confidence, as well as their capacity to offer active engagement with multiple approaches that can support the diversity of student thinking found in problem solving situations. The activities selected, and the associated group projects, will also cross-curricular boundaries and cultural boundaries to connect mathematics and spatial reasoning to real world experiences. These activities and reflections will also connect to learning objectives and concepts from science, social sciences such as geography, and visual arts, supporting a broad range of connected student learning in the STEM and STEAM disciplines, and beyond. A key component will be building and exploring embodied approaches, including spatial reasoning, kinesthetic and spatial-visual representations to support learning and thinking for children and in the elementary classrooms. These approaches are also central in the practices of mathematics, the sciences and many of the arts, at all levels and across most cultures. They will support a lifetime of student and teacher learning."

The enormous size of todays data sets and the specific requirements of modern applications necessitated the growth of a new generation of data management systems, where the emphasis is put on distributed and fault-tolerant processing. New programming paradigms have evolved, an abundance of information platforms offering data management and analysis solutions appeared and a number of novel methods and tools have been developed. This course introduces the fundamentals of big data storage, retrieval, and processing systems. As these fundamentals are introduced, exemplary technologies are used to illustrate how big data systems can leverage very large data sets that become available through multiple sources and are characterized by diverse levels of volume (terabytes; billion records), velocity (batch; real-time; streaming) and variety (structured; semi-structured; unstructured). The course aims to provide students with both theoretical knowledge and practical experience of the field by covering recent research on big data systems and their basic properties. Students consider both small and large datasets because both are equally important and justify different trade-offs. Topics include: software frameworks for distributed storage and processing of very large data sets, MapReduce programming model, querying of structured data sets, column stores, key-value stores, document stores, graph databases, distributed stream processing frameworks.

"Description": "Despite the apparent presentness of contemporary society, these are memory-obsessed times. The function of memory in individual and collective identity has become an object of inquiry in many academic disciplines, introducing reflexive analysis of archiving processes into the long-standing evidentiary function of the archive in the historical study of empirical reality. The advent of digital technologies with their shift in the techniques of conservation and classification and a consequent rhetoric of instantaneity and simultaneity, has provoked a sense of imminent breakdown in the protocols of transmission of the traces of the past, even as digitization renews the utopian impulse of the archive in its embodiment of desire for mastery of a quasi-infinity of cultural materials. The dialectic of accumulation and dissemination-of hierarchization and destabilization--is only one of the paradoxes generated by the archive. Both a physical site--an enclosed institutional space--it is also an imaginative site, a conceptual space of changing limits. The physical space that contains them, the archive is also the material traces of the past so contained. Additionally, noun metamorphoses into a verb, associated with the ensemble of operations within this space that confers order on the contents in the creation of a system of classification so as to sift, interpret and transmit material traces. To archive documents is to enclose them in a myriad of complex containers--stone, metal, acid-free folders, or even electronic pulses--that structure the archivable content as it comes into existence and in its relation to the future. Archiving contributes thus to the transformation of documents into monuments with symbolic functions. Yet despite its etymology that signifies both origin and command, the archive confounds beginnings and order alike as it exceeds the logic of historical temporality: its teleological function and claims to universality are short-circuited in its un"

"Department": "FACC", 
"Course": "FACC 6400 3.00 - Research Methods and Statistical Inference", 
"Description": "This course has four principal objectives. The first is to help students take a more structured and scientific approach to the evaluation of data. Managers are literally bombarded with data (the information overload problem) and must be able to filter and assess the quality of such data before inputting into managerial decision models. The ability to evaluate the quality of data and to make generalizations from it using the principles of statistical inference are critical skills for all mangers. The second objective of the course is to show how risk and uncertainty can be incorporated into decision making using techniques such as Probability theory and Bayesian inference. The third objective to show how data is qualitatively evaluated using the principles of evidence. Managers should be adept in evaluating both the sufficiency and persuasiveness of evidence used in decision models. The fourth objective is to show students how to prepare a research proposal to address any business problem. This is obviously essential for students pursuing the major paper option, but any manager benefits from recognizing when sound methodological principles have been followed in researching a business question. Managers read and possibly rely on many research reports over their careers and it is important to be able to distinguish good research from weak research."

This course looks at these issues and identifies best practices to strengthen corporate governance and accountability in the organization through appropriate design of executive compensation schemes.

There will be an emphasis on how theoretical understandings must underpin notions of pedagogy and classroom practice, and how practice can be interrogated in light of these theoretical frameworks. The expectation is that effective practitioners have a strong sense of what they know and how they know it, and what they are doing and why they are doing it. The general approach of the course will be exploratory rather than didactic. At all levels, learning can be thought of as research: an active construction of personal knowledge, based on formulating and testing hypotheses and, in light of an evaluation of the results, modifying ones beliefs and practices. In this spirit, we shall attempt to make connections between the reading, writing and discussion that take place in the course, and the reading, writing and discussion of the classroom setting. Class sessions will vary in format and will include discussions of the readings which are set for each week, lectures, guest presentations and work on individual and group projects.

"Description": "Explores the universe beyond our solar system. We begin by studying how gravity triggers fusion reactions in starts that create heat, light, and every element in our bodies except hydrogen: overall, stars shine by converting mass into energy (Einsteins E=mc^2). We discuss how we can use the corpses of stars (white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes) to probe how space and time are related via Einsteins theories of relativity. We examine how stars are bound together into galaxies by gravity and how to use various wavelengths of light to determine why there are different types of galaxies: elegant spirals, massive ellipticals, and faint dwarf galaxies. We learn how the Doppler effect reveals that dark matter must produce some of the gravity that binds stars into galaxies, galaxies into clusters of galaxies, and clusters of galaxies into superclusters. We explore how we can use distant galaxies to study the development of the universe over its entire history, including the increasing importance of dark energy. We confront both the earliest instants and the far future of our universes history: what we know, what we still hope to learn, and what we think we can ever learn. Finally, we join some modern scientists in the speculation about whether or not other universes might exist beyond the one we can perceive. Course credit exclusions: SC/NATS 1740 6.00.

"Description": "Our common ideas about international politics present a reified world of diplomats, heads of state, military officers or, more abstractly, of states acting in some way. This course asks: What can we learn about international politics from popular culture? The common notions of international politics are certainly found in many of the expressions or contemporary popular culture: novels, television, and, particularly, film have made the world of international espionage one of its staples. With the declaration of a war on terror in 2001, terrorists and the provision of security against them have also provided important themes for popular entertainments. However, by virtue of being popular, popular culture also presents the possibilities of politics that are not abstracted and insulated from the concerns and experiences of everyday life and experience. Thus, while international politics in popular culture can reproduce alienated or elite versions of our worlds politics it can also be a site of resistance, and even more importantly a place to imagine international politics differently. This course draws the popular culture in which we all live in our daily lives into the classroom, beginning from popular culture expressions to explore the nature, limits, and possibilities of contemporary international politics.

"Description": "Despite the apparent presentness of contemporary society, these are memory-obsessed times. The function of memory in individual and collective identity has become an object of inquiry in many academic disciplines, introducing reflexive analysis of archiving processes into the long-standing evidentiary function of the archive in the historical study of empirical reality. The advent of digital technologies with their shift in the techniques of conservation and classification and a consequent rhetoric of instantaneity and simultaneity, has provoked a sense of imminent breakdown in the protocols of transmission of the traces of the past, even as digitization renews the utopian impulse of the archive in its embodiment of desire for mastery of a quasi-infinity of cultural materials. The dialectic of accumulation and dissemination-of hierarchization and destabilization--is only one of the paradoxes generated by the archive. Both a physical site--an enclosed institutional space--it is also an imaginative site, a conceptual space of changing limits. The physical space that contains them, the archive is also the material traces of the past so contained. Additionally, noun metamorphoses into a verb, associated with the ensemble of operations within this space that confers order on the contents in the creation of a system of classification so as to sift, interpret and transmit material traces. To archive documents is to enclose them in a myriad of complex containers--stone, metal, acid-free folders, or even electronic pulses--that structure the archivable content as it comes into existence and in its relation to the future. Archiving contributes thus to the transformation of documents into monuments with symbolic functions. Yet despite its etymology that signifies both origin and command, the archive confounds beginnings and order alike as it exceeds the logic of historical temporality: its teleological function and claims to universality are short-circuited in its un"

Assignments will consist of series projects exploring different working processes and sculptural methodologies. In addition to these projects there will be in-class discussions, technical assignments and readings that will engage students in the dialogue surrounding contemporary concerns associated with abstraction and spatial awareness. Craftsmanship and a demonstrated knowledge of material are a major factor in this course. In order for students to be able to fully articulate their idea in a given material, they must understand the limits and possibilities inherent in the construction process. It is expected that each student will develop a degree of sophistication and competence when working with this material. Lectures, demonstrations, group critiques and most importantly, hands on instruction are the essential means by which we will investigate sculptural problem solving. The class will participate in material specific demonstrations and/or class critiques of finished work.
